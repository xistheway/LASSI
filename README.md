# LASSI
Welcome to LASSI, our Likelihood-based Approach for Selective Sweep Inference. Most (if not all) of what you need to know in order to use this software is contained within the manual. As a quick rundown, in order to use this software, make sure that you have: placed all analysis scripts in the same directory as your data, converted your data to LASSI-compatible format, and determined what your window and step size will be for your sliding window analysis.
